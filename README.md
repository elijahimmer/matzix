# MatZix
A school project for matrix math.

## Progression:
- General:
    - Uniform Matrix
    - Multiplicative + Additive Identities
    - TODO: making row operations

    - Transposing
    - Matrix Addition + Subtraction
    - Scalar Addition + Subtraction
    - Scalar Multiplication + Division

- Matrix Multiplication:
    - dot-product
    - dot-product transpose
    - dot-product SIMD optimized
    - dot-product transpose SIMD optimized
    - TODO: find faster ways to calculate it

- Determinate:
    - TODO: Start on these
